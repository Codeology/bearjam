<h1>BearJam 🥑</h1>
<h3>Project Leaders: Anna Chung, Natalie Wei</h3>

Learn about 2D game development from start to finish using Unity & C#! In this project we’ll delve into game development fundamentals like scripting, coroutines, physics, and animation, all while building a suite of your own games in Unity! Finally, to show off everything you’ve learned, you’ll get to participate in a collaborative “game jam” with other group members to develop a new game from scratch.
