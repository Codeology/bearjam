<h1>BearJam</h1>
<h3>Project Leaders: Anna Chung, Natalie Wei</h3>

Learn about 2D game development from start to finish using Unity & C#! In this project we’ll delve into the fundamentals of game development such as scripting, incorporating physics, animation, and more – all while building a suite of your own games in Unity! Finally, to show everything you’ve learned, you’ll get to participate in a collaborative “game jam” with other group members to develop an original game of your choice!
